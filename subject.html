In computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization,<br/>
 and implementation of computer systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming
 model of a computer but not a particular implementation.<br/>
 In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.<br/>

<br/>
<ol>
<li><font color="#ff8c00" size="4">Instruction set architecture (ISA):</font> defines the machine code that a processor<br/>
 reads and acts upon as well as the word size, memory address modes, processor registers, and data type<br/></li><br/>
<li><font color="#ff8c00" size="4">Microarchitecture:</font> also known as "computer organization",<br/> this describes how 
a particular processor will implement the ISA.<br/>
 The size of a computer's CPU cache for instance, is an issue that generally has nothing to do with the ISA<br/></li>
<br/>
<li><font color="#ff8c00" size="4">Systems design:</font> includes all of the other hardware components within a computing system,<br/>
 such as data processing other than the CPU (e.g., direct memory access), virtualization, and multiprocessing<br/></li><br/>

Computer architecture is concerned with balancing the performance, efficiency, cost, and reliability of a computer system.<br/>
 The case of instruction set architecture can be used to illustrate the balance of these competing factors.<br/>
 More complex instruction sets enable programmers to write more space efficient programs,
 since a single instruction can encode some higher-level abstraction (such as the x86 Loop instruction).<br/>
 However, longer and more complex instructions take longer for the processor to decode and can be more costly to implement effectively.<br/>
 The increased complexity from a large instruction set also creates more room for unreliability when instructions interact in unexpected ways.<br/>
The implementation involves integrated circuit design, packaging, power, and cooling.<br/>
 Optimization of the design requires familiarity with compilers, operating systems to logic design, and packaging<br/>
