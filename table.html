<br/>
The SISD class of processor architecture includes most commonly available computers. These processors are 
known as uniprocessors and can be found in millions of embedded processors in video games and home appliances 
as well as stand?alone processors in home computers, engineering workstations, and mainframe computers.<br/>
 Although a programmer may not realize the inherent parallelism within these processors, a good deal of concurrency can be present.<br/>
 Pipelining is a powerful technique that is used in almost all current processor implementations.<br/>
 Other techniques aggressively exploit parallelism in executing code whether it is declared statically or
 determined dynamically from an analysis of the code stream.<br/>

During execution, a SISD processor executes one or more operations per clock cycle from the instruction stream.<br/>
 An instruction is a container that represents the smallest execution packet managed explicitly by the processor.<br/>
 One or more operations are contained within an instruction. The distinction between instructions and operations is
 crucial to distinguish between processor behaviors.<br/>
 Scalar and superscalar processors consume one or more instructions per cycle where each instruction contains a single operation.<br/>

<b/> VLIW processors, on the other hand, consume a single instruction per cycle where this instruction contains multiple operations.<br/>

A SISD processor has four primary characteristics.<br/>
 The first characteristic is whether the processor is capable of executing multiple operations concurrently.<br/>
<br/> The second characteristic is the mechanisms by which operations are scheduled for execution—statically at compile time, dynamically at execution, or possibly
 both.<br/>
 The third characteristic is the order that operations are issued and retired relative to the original program order—these operations can be in order or out of order.
<br/> The fourth characteristic is the manner in which exceptions are handled by the processor—precise, imprecise, or a combination.
<br/> This last condition is not of immediate concern 
to the applications programmer, although it is certainly important to the compiler writer or operating system programmer
who must be able to properly handle exception conditions.<br/>
Most processors implement precise exceptions,<br/>
although a few high?performance architectures allow imprecise floating?point exceptions.<br/><br/><hr/>
